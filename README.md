###YourFolio

## Inspiration
The inspiration for the project "YourFolio" came from the need to simplify the process of creating professional portfolio websites. Many individuals, whether they are job seekers, freelancers, or professionals in various fields, struggle with designing and developing their own portfolio websites. The aim was to create a tool that allows users to easily generate customized and visually appealing portfolio websites without the need for extensive coding knowledge.

## What it does
YourFolio is a portfolio generator that enables users to create personalized portfolio websites by providing their information and selecting various customizable options. Users can input their name, about section, contact details, education, experiences, skills, projects, and social links. The platform offers a user-friendly interface with dynamic input forms that allow users to add, edit, and remove sections as needed. The generated portfolio website showcases the user's information in a professional and visually appealing manner, with different sections like home, about, education, experience, skills, and social links. It also has **import from github** options to make your portfolio with ease.
The importing of projects and profile from github makes it very easy for a person to generate their portfolio.

**Most important point is that, THE FINAL PORTFOLIO WEBSITE WHICH IS GENERATED IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. **

**Guess what  - You can download your resume as well from the portfolio website with an amazing look without any hassle.**

**Thats what makes our site unique and the best. Generate a beautiful portfolio - either give data yourselft or let github  do your task. Make your portfolio with ease with - YourFolio the one and only site present in market**

## How we built it
The project was built using Next.js, a React framework for server-side rendering and building web applications. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to structure and style the components. Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, was employed for creating responsive and modern designs. Axios was utilized for making API calls to retrieve and update data from the backend. The application architecture followed a component-based approach, with reusable components for forms, cards, and sections.

We also tried implementing an automatic about/project/experiecne sections using openai (the code is still present) but  due to some internal server errors we couldnt do it. But I found this idea very unqiue and hassle free for all kind of users coming on our site and making their portfolio.

## Challenges we ran into
During the development process, several challenges were encountered. Some of the main challenges included:

* Implementing dynamic form inputs to allow users to add, edit, and remove sections like education, experience, and skills.
* Since my teamate was first timer in field of hackathons , collaborating with him was a bit difficult at first but we managed our time accordingly and were able to come up with something brilliant idea as yourfolio at the end.
* Integrating external APIs to fetch data from platforms like GitHub and LinkedIn.
* Designing and implementing responsive and visually appealing card layouts for education, experience, and skills sections.
* Handling user authentication and database storage for collaboration and feedback features.
* Optimizing the performance and loading speed of the portfolio generator.
* **I was trying to add an openai about section/project description where people can give their own suggestions and based on that they get their beautiful about section but unfortunately the API was not working properly at that given time so we just added the code for future.**

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Throughout the development of YourFolio, several accomplishments were achieved:

* Successful implementation of a dynamic form system that allows users to add, edit, and remove sections dynamically.
* Integration with external APIs to fetch data from platforms like GitHub and LinkedIn, enhancing the user's portfolio with real-time data.
* Designing and implementing visually appealing and responsive card layouts for education, experience, and skills sections, providing an engaging user experience.
