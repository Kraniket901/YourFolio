## Inspiration
The inspiration for the project "YourFolio" came from the need to simplify the process of creating professional portfolio websites. Many individuals, whether they are job seekers, freelancers, or professionals in various fields, struggle with designing and developing their own portfolio websites. The aim was to create a tool that allows users to easily generate customized and visually appealing portfolio websites without the need for extensive coding knowledge.

## What it does
YourFolio is a portfolio generator that enables users to create personalized portfolio websites by providing their information and selecting various customizable options. Users can input their name, about section, contact details, education, experiences, skills, projects, and social links. The platform offers a user-friendly interface with dynamic input forms that allow users to add, edit, and remove sections as needed. The generated portfolio website showcases the user's information in a professional and visually appealing manner, with different sections like home, about, education, experience, skills, and social links. It also has **import from github** options to make your portfolio with ease.
The importing of projects and profile from github makes it very easy for a person to generate their portfolio.

Most important point is that, THE FINAL PORTFOLIO WEBSITE WHICH IS GENERATED IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. 

## How we built it
The project was built using Next.js, a React framework for server-side rendering and building web applications. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to structure and style the components. Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, was employed for creating responsive and modern designs. Axios was utilized for making API calls to retrieve and update data from the backend. The application architecture followed a component-based approach, with reusable components for forms, cards, and sections.
